## Project Motivation

For this project, stack overflow survey data from 2017 was analyzed to better understand:

1.  What are the most common languages for professional developers and how does that compare to non-professional developers?
2.  Is there a relationship between job satisfaction and working from home, and does this vary by gender?
3.  What are the job benefits most important to survey respondants and does this vary by gender?

## Libraries used

### pandas

## Conclusions
1. Javascipt is the most used programming language for both professional and non-professional developers, and there is no significant diffference between the languages used by professional and non-professional developers.

2. Job satifaction for men was highest when working from home most of the time. However, job satisfaction for women working home most of the time ranked in the bottom half of those surveyed.

3. Vacation, Remote Options, and Health Benfefits were the most important benefits regardless of gender.
